section rules

-- Conjunction rules
rule "true ∧ X  →  X"
rule "false ∧ X  →  false"
rule "X ∧ true  →  X"
rule "X ∧ false  →  false"

-- Disjunction rules
rule "true ∨ X  →  true"
rule "false ∨ X  →  X"
rule "X ∨ true  →  true"
rule "X ∨ false  →  X"

-- Equality rules
rule "0 = 0  →  true"
rule "s(X) = 0  →  false"
rule "0 = s(X)  →  false"
rule "s(X) = s(Y)  →  X = Y"

-- Membership rules
rule "X ∈ ε  →  false"
rule "X ∈ Y · YS  →  X = Y ∨ X ∈ YS"

-- Set inclusion rules
rule "ε ⊆ YS  →  true"
rule "X · XS ⊆ YS  →  X ∈ YS ∧ XS ⊆ YS"
